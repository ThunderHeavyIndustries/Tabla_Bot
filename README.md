# Tabla_Bot
The code for my twitter bot that responds to tweets by returning a short tabla composition.

You'll need the twitter gem: https://github.com/sferik/twitter

It may or may not be running, try it out by tweeting @Tabla_Bot
or check it out at: https://twitter.com/tabla_bot

If you want to create your own you'll need to supply all your own user name/password/keys. Those go under the account method.
